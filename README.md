# Accident-Prediction
Event Processing Networks for Traffic Congestion Management for Accident Prediction, Notification &amp; Assistance.

This project dealt with proposing strategies to address the following business objectives:

•	To alert the drivers on the expressway about an impending traffic jam.

•	To design EPN to predict accidents on given arterial road segments based on speed bands, weather conditions and time of accident.

•	To design EPN that would trigger the necessary assistance needed if there is an accident on the road, if there is a vehicle breakdown or if there is an unattended vehicle.

The skills used in this project were EPN,Python,SQL Server,Web scraping,Data visualization,Exploratory Data Analysis,Predictive Modelling for accidents.
In addition to this, Google APIs,Excel and bootstrap were also used for completion of this project.
